  <h4>Culture</h4>
  <p>
    Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.
    <br />
    Culture is the patterns of learned and shared behavior and beliefs of a particular social, ethnic, or age group. It can also be described as the complex whole of collective human beliefs with a structured stage of civilization that can be
    specific to a nation or time period. Humans in turn use culture to adapt and transform the world they live in.
